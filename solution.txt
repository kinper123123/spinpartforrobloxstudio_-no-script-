Make a base for your spin part, and then copy the basepart and rename it to spin part. Now move the spinpart upwards for just about 1 stud, Then go to the Models tab and press the button that says "Create" Now if you clicked it, Press hinge, Now move your mouse under and the middle of the spin part. and click, Now connect it to the BasePart. Once thats done, Move it back (down) to the base part. Now select the SpinPart > HingeConstraint, Now look in the properties and scroll down a bit until you see the property ActuatorType, Now click on it. And click "Motor" 
You will see another cetegory called "Motor" So there AngularVelocity is the speed of the spinning, MotorMaxAcceleration is VERY important. DO NOT CHANGE MotorMaxAcceleration UNLESS IF YOU KNOW ABOUT IT! MotorMaxTorque is set to 0, It is reccomended to put it as 900000. So there! If you run the game your spin part is done! Enjoy!
